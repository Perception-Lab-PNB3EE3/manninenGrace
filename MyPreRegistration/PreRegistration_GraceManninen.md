# Study Information 

## 1. Title 

The Role of Serial Dependence in Animal Perception: Increasing Conservation Efforts for Scary and Repulsive Species

## 2. Authors 

Grace Manninen

## 3. Description 

Animal conservation efforts are often given to more well-known, and more preferred animals [@Castillo-Huitrón2020Importance]. It is important to maintain biodiversity in animal species, and one way to conserve biodiversity is to change human behaviors and attitudes towards certain species [@Kidda2019Messaging].

Our brains are affected by a phenomenon known as serial dependence. Serial dependence describes how previous trial stimuli affect the perception of current stimuli [@StJohn-Saaltink2015Serial]. Our brain’s are also fine-tuned to pay more attention to animal stimuli, this is known as the “animate monitoring hypothesis” [@New2007Category]. Although it is not understood why animals are a more attractive stimulus [@Borgi2016Pet]. The amygdala, located within the brain, plays a specific role in responding to animal stimuli, adverse or cute [@Mormann2011Category]. The amygdala also functions to process fear-generating stimuli. Fear-generating stimuli could be animals that evolutionarily posed a threat to human life. Threatening stimuli are kept in memory, so that they can be avoided in the future [@Castillo-Huitrón2020Importance]

Considering all this, I want to study whether serial dependence alters the perception of animals, specifically causing the perception of originally scary or repulsive animals to become more likeable. 

To study this, preferred animals will be used as the prior stimulus to test serial dependence effects. It is seen that more phylogenetically similar animals are often more preferred by humans, while less phylogenetically similar animals (fish, reptiles, invertebrates, etc.) are not as preferred. But, what has been seen to have the greatest effect in seeing how much animals are preferred, is if they have been anthropomorphized [@Borgi2016Pet]. Anthropomorphism increases how much an animal is preferred, because there is a realization of shared features [@Allison2024Effects]. Anthropomorphized species are often given personalities through their physical characteristics, which generate emotional responses towards the animal.  By increasing emotional responses towards the animal and generating more positive feelings, then it may improve the attitude towards that species, allowing it to become more likely for conservation efforts to be increased [@Castillo-Huitrón2020Importance]. Another way to generate positive attitudes towards an animals is through framing the animals as in need of caregiving [@Borgi2016Pet]. 


For my study I want to look at if attitudes towards scary and repulsive animals can be made more positive through the effects of serial dependence by using charismatic animals as prior stimuli. It is important to note that some animals are often underrepresented or misrepresented in animal conservation efforts, this is known as taxonomic bias. Anthropods and mullosca are often underrepresented, while insecta are often misrepresented [@Trouder2017Taxonomic]. So learning new ways to help frame certain species in a more positive light, could help maintain biodiversity globally. 

Charismatic species are species that humans are more drawn to, and are more willingly funded for conservation efforts[@Albert2018Twenty]. A study done by @Albert2018Twenty found that the twenty most charismatic species, in the order of most charismatic to least were; tiger, lion, elephant, giraffe, leopard, panda, cheetah, polar bear, wolf, gorilla, chimpanzee, zebra, hippopotamus, great white shark, crocodile, dolphin, rhinoceros, brown bear, koala, and blue whale. 

A study done by @Polák2020Scary looked at the most common phobia animals. They found that the most highly feared animals were the viper, wasp, snake, and bull. While the most highly repulsive were the roundworm, tapeworm, maggot, louse, and cockroach. The species inbetween the two was interestingly the spider. These animals (viper, wasp, snake, bull, roundworm, tapeworm, maggot, louse, cockroach, and spider) will be used as the not-preffered animals in my experiment. 

## 4. Hypotheses 

Participants who first view a charismatic species will rate a subsequent scary or repulsive species more positively and show greater willingness to support its conservation compared to participants who first view a neutral stimulus (fixation cross).


# Design Plan 

Each participant will be randomly assigned to: Block 1, or Block 2
Block 1:
Stimulus #1: randomly assigned charismatic animal
Questions (6): How funny is the animal? How motherly is the animal? How friendly is the animal? How cute is the animal? How protective of their young is the animal? If this species were going extinct, would you help?
Stimulus #2: randomly assigned scary or repulsive animal 
Questions (6): How funny is the animal? How motherly is the animal? How friendly is the animal? How cute is the animal? How protective of their young is the animal? If this species were going extinct, would you help?

Block 2: 
Stimulus #1: fixation cross
Questions: none
Stimulus #2: randomly assigned scary or repulsive animal 
Questions (6): How funny is the animal? How motherly is the animal? How friendly is the animal? How cute is the animal? How protective of their young is the animal? If this species were going extinct, would you help?

## 5. Study type 

 Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.


## 6. Blinding 

Participants will be unaware of what the study is looking at. They will be unaware if they are in block 1 or block 2. 
The experiment conductor (Grace Manninen), will not know what block each participant is in, until after all the data is collected and statistical analysis is done. 
It will be a double-blind study. 


## 7. Is there any additional blinding in this study? 

n/a

## 8. Study design 

This is a between-participant design. 

## 9. Randomization 

Participants will be randomized between either Block 1 or Block 2

In Block 1
Prior stimuli of a charismatic animals (20), will be randomly assigned to each trial (1-10)
Each trial (1-10) of scary/repulsive animals will be random 
*** 184756 different combinations 

In Block 2
Prior stimuli is a fixation cross
Each trial (1-10) of scary/repulsive animals will be random


# Sampling Plan 

Samples will be collected using an online survey. 

## 10. Existing data 

-   [x] Registration prior to creation of data: As of the date of submission of this research plan for preregistration, the data have not yet been collected, created, or realized.

## 11. Explanation of existing data 

n/a 

## 12. Data collection procedures 

data will be collected from each participant by them participating in the online survey. 

## 13. Sample size 

The number of participants in each block does not need to be equal. (n1≠n2)
Block 1 -> group 1: median 4
Block 2 -> group 2: median 4
*** ^ median of likert scale (1-7)
For a medium effect size d= 0.8, and α = 0.5, 

from G*Power 3.1:
[1] -- Friday, February 28, 2025 -- 16:09:54
t tests - Means: Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (two groups)
Options:	A.R.E. method
Analysis:	A priori: Compute required sample size 
Input:		Tail(s)                       	=	Two
			Parent distribution           	=	Normal
			Effect size d                 	=	0.8
			α err prob                    	=	0.05
			Power (1-β err prob)          	=	0.95
			Allocation ratio N2/N1        	=	1
Output:		Noncentrality parameter δ     	=	3.6667983
			Critical t                    	=	1.9893063
			Df                            	=	82.0338100
			Sample size group 1           	=	44
			Sample size group 2           	=	44
			Total sample size             	=	88
			Actual power                  	=	0.9519016
			

44 samples will be needed for each block 


## 14. Sample size rationale 

We used the software program G\*Power to conduct a power analysis. Our goal was to obtain .95 power to detect a medium effect size of .8 at the standard .05 alpha error probability.

details above in #13

Any sociocultural group can be used for this study, since there is no bias in choice of charismatic animals that would found in @Albert2018Twenty study. 
Ages 18+ can complete the study 
Any gender/gender identity/sex can complete the study 

***People with phobias of animals should not complete the study

## 15. Stopping rule 

terminate data collection once suffiecient data (n=44) has been collected. 

# Variables 


## 16. Manipulated variables 

if a charismatic species was viewed first (Block 1) or if a fixation cross was viewed first (Block 2)

## 17. Measured variables 

Measures from the survey questions
The survey questions (6) are: 
How funny is this animal?
How motherly is this animal?
How friendly is this animal?
How cute is this animal?
How protective of their young is this animal?
If this species were going extinct, how likely would you be to support its conservation?

They will be answered on a 7-point Likert scale
1 = Not at all, 7 = extremely 


## 18. Indices 

will not be taking the mean, as will be using a Mann-Whitney U-test

# Analysis Plan 

Independent variables: if a charismatic species was viewed first (Block 1) or if a fixation cross was viewed first (Block 2)
Dependent variables: Survey questions (6), each answered on a scale of 1-7

## 19. Statistical models 

I will run a non-parametric test once data is collected. A Mann-Whitney U test will be run. This will test if there is a significant difference between ratings from block 1 and block 2. 

## 20. Transformations 

n/a

## 21. Inference criteria 

I will use p-values to test statistical power, effect-size, and U value.


## 22. Data exclusion 




## 23. Missing data 

Data will be discarded if:
Any questions go unanswered by a participant
If the participant puts the same rating on the Likert scale for all of the questions


## 24. Exploratory analysis 

expect that charismatic species being shown first will result in higherratings on the likert scale
